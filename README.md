TICTAC: BASIC TIc Tac Toe game for Tandy Color Computer 3
==========

![](images/screenshot.jpg)

I wrote this Tic Tac Toe game in BASIC for a Tandy Color Computer 3.

The program is written to use my BASIC preprocessor so the code can be all pretty, and the preprocessor converts it to
sensible, legal BASIC for the Coco3.  See my [preprocessor](https://github.com/yggdrasilradio/preprocessor) repository for that.

Look in the [redistribute](https://github.com/yggdrasilradio/tictac/tree/master/redistribute) folder for the program in normal DECB ASCII format.
